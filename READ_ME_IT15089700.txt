Sir,

I needed datepicker for my form (drug store).
But, HTML 5 doesn't allow/show datepicker in some browsers like firefox (also in Eclipse as well).
(Allows in Google Chrome)

Therefore,
I have added another code which helps to show/visible datepicker even in eclipse and other browsers which do not allow HTML5 datepicker.

All the CRUD are working correctly in google chrome and eclipse.
but,
I would like to request from you to use google chrome if eclipse doesn't perform update function for 'Expire date' field correcly.
